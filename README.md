## Objective :
 The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) that includes both univariate and bivariate analyses. This analysis aims to:
*  Understand the distribution of individual variables (univariate analysis).
*  Identify outliers within the dataset.
*  Explore relationships between different variables (bivariate analysis) to uncover insights related to salary expectations.
*  The analysis involves visualizing the data, identifying trends and patterns, and testing hypotheses to derive meaningful insights.
* These insights can guide decision-making processes and improve salary prediction models.
 
## Data Steps for analyze the dataset:
* Data Cleaning.
* Data Manipulation
* Univariate Analaysis
* Bivariate Analysis
